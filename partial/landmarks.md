<div class="caption">The impressive Gurara Falls is 30m tall where water crashes off the cliff face in a powerful curtain of water. It is most impressive in the rainy season, when powerful torrents of water crash down. During the dry season, water levels are low and visitors can swim in pools at the bottom. <a href="http://www.filepicker.io/api/file/nzoqHkQISOy5r8prZb6U">Original Source</a></div>
