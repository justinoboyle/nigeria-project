# Language

There is a lot of lingual diversity in Nigeria. While English serves as official language of government, commerce, and education, there are over 500 languages spoken throughout the country. English was a former colonial language, and was chosen to help unify Nigeria linguistically. Educated Nigerians usually speak several languages. Local dominant languages include Hausa in the North, Yoruba in the West, and Igbo in the East, which roughly divides on the same lines that [religion](religion) does. In Nigerian [cities](cities), most people will understand and speak English. In more rural areas, people are more likely to use the local language of that region. Sometimes, a mix of English and the local dialect is used to make communicating with speakers of all languages easier.
