# Climate

Like everything else about Nigeria, the climate has wide variations that is related to its geography. There are two general seasons: wet and dry. But in the coastal areas, they are less sharply defined. Temperatures are higher in the north (frequently rising over 100Â°F), but humidity is greater at the coast. Inland, the seasons are quite distinct; a wet season from April to October and a dry season from November to March. Temperatures are highest in February to April in the South, and from March to June in the North. July and August are the lowest temperatures throughout the country. Rainfall also varies by location, averaging about 70in on the Western coast to 170in on the Eastern edge of the coast. The central plateau areas may have about 50in and the savannas of the north may only have 20in.
