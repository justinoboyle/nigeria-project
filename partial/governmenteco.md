# Government and Economy

Nigeria is a federal republic. The president has far-reaching power, although he is controlled somewhat by Parliament. The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria was established in 1999, and is the supreme law of the land, guaranteeing fundimental rights. It lays out the powers of the executive, legislative and judiciary branches of the government, as well as the three-tier system of federal, state and local government. All laws must be valid against the Constitution. Although this Consitution prohibits establishing a state religion, in recent years Muslim Sharia Law has gained influence in some parts of the country. The terrorist group Boko Haram has, in recent years, taken over some of the northern states of Nigeria, and the government declared a state of emergency in those regions in 2013. In 2015, Mohammadu Buhari, a former military head of state, won the presidency on a promise to re-establish security in the northern states and to fight government corruption.

The major law-making body is the National Assembly, made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Supreme Court is the highest court int he land, composed of 20 justices.

Economically, the major challenge for Nigeria is the competition between ethnic regions for control of the petroleum products and natural gas in the delta region. Major exports for Nigeria are petroleum products, cocoa and rubber. The major imports are machinery, chemicals and manufactured goods.
